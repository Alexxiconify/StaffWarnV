# Plugin Overview
This is a Velocity plugin that alerts staff members when they use commands that regular players don't have access to.

Permission Tracking: The plugin checks if the command's required permission is available to default player groups.
LuckPerms Integration: Uses the LuckPerms API to check permissions across different server contexts.
Origin Identification: Shows which permission group granted the staff member access to the command.
